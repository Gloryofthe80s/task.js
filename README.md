task.js
=======

This is a simple, lightweight "to-do" web app, patterned after [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).

Strangely enough, this was constructed pre-MVC knowledge, and is a classic example of jQuery/JS spaghetti code. 

I started rewriting this using Backbone in another repo after I became familiar with MVC design pattern. Persistent data was not implemented, so all tasks are lost on refresh or page close.

###Instructions

Site here: <http://gloryofthe80s.github.io/task.js>

Enter in the tasks you need to accomplish.
Check them off. 
Delete them when you're done.

Don't refresh the page. Unless, of course, you want to immediately get all your tasks done.
